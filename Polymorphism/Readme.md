# Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same message
in different ways.

The key idea is **behavior substitution at runtime**, not conditionals
or type checks.

This package demonstrates:
- How polymorphism removes branching logic
- How new behavior can be added without modifying existing code
