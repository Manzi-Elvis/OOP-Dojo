# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is about **protecting an object’s internal state** and exposing behavior through controlled interfaces.

The goal is not to hide data for the sake of hiding it, but to:
- Enforce invariants
- Prevent invalid state
- Reduce unintended coupling

This package demonstrates:
- ❌ What happens when internal state is exposed
- ✅ How controlled access improves correctness and maintainability
